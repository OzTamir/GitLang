GitLang
=========

Just a little tool I wrote in Javascript to display a bar chart of the languges in a certin GitHub Repository.

Tools in use:
---
 - [ZURB's Foundation] (https://github.com/zurb/foundation) For HTML and responsiveness across devices.
 - [move.js] (https://github.com/visionmedia/move.js) For the transitions.
 - [animate.css] (https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) For some more transitions.
 - [d3] (https://github.com/mbostock/d3) For the bar charts...
 - [GitHub API] (https://developer.github.com/v3/) For the data
